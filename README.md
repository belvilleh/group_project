# Seattle Traffic Congestion Study

## Project Description

The primary question we aim to answer is: Can we accurately predict the hourly volume (flow) prediction, given current and recent historical traffic data, temporal features, and relevant weather conditions?

Answering this question is important because:

Enables Proactive Management: Accurate short-term predictions (15-30 minutes) are the foundation for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications, such as dynamic ramp metering, variable speed limits, and traveler information services (e.g., advising commuters to take transit or alternative routes before congestion hits).

Improves Resource Allocation: Forecasting congestion allows WSDOT and emergency services to better position resources, particularly during major accidents or inclement weather, minimizing secondary incidents and reducing overall delay.

## Project Overview

Seattle is consistently ranked as one of the most congested cities in the United States, with drivers losing significant time and productivity each year. Traffic congestion not only costs the regional economy but also leads to increased vehicle emissions and delayed emergency response times. Addressing this problem requires predictive modeling that allows transportation agencies to intervene proactively.
The goal of this project is to develop a robust, data-driven model for short-term traffic congestion forecasting on a critical segment of the Puget Sound region’s infrastructure: Interstate 5 (I-5) within the Seattle metropolitan area.
